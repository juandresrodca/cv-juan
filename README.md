This project serves as my digital cover letter and portfolio, showcasing my skills and experience as an IT Support Specialist and Cybersecurity. It was implemented using modern web technologies and provided a great opportunity to explore Astro, React, and related frontend development practices.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio is built with the following key technologies:

* **Astro:** A modern static site builder that allows for building fast content-focused websites. It's used as the primary framework for structuring the project and rendering Markdown content.

  * [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/)

* **React:** Utilized within Astro for interactive UI components.

  * [React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn)

* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and responsive styling.

  * [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Powers dynamic interactions, animations, and client-side logic.

  * [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

* **Chart.js:** A flexible JavaScript charting library used for creating interactive data visualizations.

  * [Chart.js Documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)

* **GitHub Pages:** Hosts the live version of the portfolio directly from the GitHub repository.

  * [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

* **GitHub Actions:** Automates the build and deployment process to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
